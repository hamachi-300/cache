cache memory simulation. computer architecture project

# contents of mapping_simulation
- Directed Mapping Technique
- N Way Set Associative Technique
- Fully Set Associative Technique
- LRU (Least Recently Used) in set associative

# contents of proxy_caching
  - Proxy Caching : it will store recently or frequency used data make you device faster fetch data from web server
  - Caching Algorithms (LRU, LFU) implementation
  - TTL (Time To Live)


# Optional Enhancements
- Cache Expiration: Implement cache expiration based on time-to-live (TTL) for cached entries. # 
- Distributed Cache: Implement a distributed cache using Redis for scalability. #
- Cache Visualization: Build a dashboard or use logging to visualize cache hits, misses, and the status of cached content. #
- Testing Load: Use tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate multiple concurrent requests and analyze performance.
- Authentication and Security: Add basic authentication to the proxy server to restrict access. #
